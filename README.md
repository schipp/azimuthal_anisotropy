# Azimuthal anisotropy from inter-station velocity measurements

Determine the 2-Theta and 4-Theta terms of azimuthal anisotropy from inter-station group-velocity residuals in overlapping cells. This methodology is established in Schippkus et al. (2020), but the original version used in the paper requires the specific output of a specific isotropic inversion code, relying on the parametrization of the isotropic inversion. This new version is based purely on a .csv file of station-pair locations and inter-station group-velocity residuals.

Format of the header-less `.csv` input: `lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, vel`

## Requirements

- Python 3.5+
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Obspy (https://github.com/obspy/obspy/wiki)
- Shapely (https://pypi.org/project/Shapely/)

## TODO

- [ ] Implement weighted median/mean using path-lengths within cells. Check https://gist.github.com/tinybike/d9ff1dad515b66cc0d87.
- [ ] Actually test with real data.
- [ ] Synthetic example that can handle varying anisotropy.
