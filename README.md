# Azimuthal anisotropy from inter-station velocity measurements

Determine the 2-Theta and 4-Theta terms of azimuthal anisotropy from inter-station group-velocity residuals. This methodology is established in Schippkus et al. (2020), but the original version used in the paper requires the specific output of a specific isotropic inversion code, relies on the parametrization of the isotropic inversion. This new version is based purely on an .csv file of station locations and inter-station group-velocity residuals.

Format of the header-less `.csv` input: `lat1, lon1, lat2, lon2, vel`
